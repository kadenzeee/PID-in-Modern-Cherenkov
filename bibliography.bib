The samples were irradiated with protons in order to emulate the expected accumulated radiation damage over the entire life span of the future PANDA experiment. Changes in optical properties were the primary focus of this study. The optical transmission over a broad wavelength band ranging from UV to visible light was investigated using a commercial spectrophotometer. In addition, changes of the polished surface were studied using an interferometer. No evidence for changes in transmission and surface quality was found within the obtained precision.}

abstract = {Ultra-smooth surface with sub-nanometer roughness is of great significance in various fields, including Ring Laser Gyro (RLG), high-power laser apparatus, ultraviolet optical systems, and the semiconductor industry. However, the mechanism of the ultra-smooth polishing process remains to be studied, which is of great value for understanding and optimizing optical-fabrication methods. This paper establishes a relationship between surface densification characteristics and surface roughness in conventional polishing. Moreover, we conclude that the densification process created by the longitudinal pressure, which avoids non-uniformity, is beneficial to forming super-smooth surfaces in the conventional polishing methods. Under this guidance, we can stably fabricate ultra-smooth surfaces on fused silica with 0.4 Å roughness. This result overturns the mainstream view that the longitudinal pressure in polishing should be minimized. This conclusion is meaningful for the understanding of the ultra-smooth surface formation not only in conventional polishing but also in other optical-fabrication technologies.}

It uses a 3 m long C4F10 radiator, a 21 m2 large VUV mirror surface and two kinds of photon detectors: MAPMTs and MWPCs with CsI photocathodes, covering a total of 5.5 m2. It is in operation since 2002 and its performance increased thanks to progressive optimization and to a major upgrade of its photon detection system, implemented in 2006; a new upgrade is foreseen for 2016, with the use of MPGD-based photon detectors.

The main characteristics of COMPASS RICH-1 components are described and the most critical aspects related to the C4F10 radiator gas system, to the mirrors and their alignment, as well as the performance of the photon detectors are presented and discussed. The response of the MWPCs and the observed evolution of the effective quantum efficiency of the CsI photocathodes is analyzed. The properties and performance of the MAPMTs with individual fused lens telescopes are presented together with the readout characteristics. The PID performance of COMPASS RICH-1 is discussed and the future upgrade program is mentioned.}

ABSTRACT = {To meet the application requirements of neutron detectors, a novel large-area microchannel plate photomultiplier tube with a gate function (G-MCP-PMT) was developed in this study. A kind of regular hexagonal mesh electrode as the gated electrode was designed to achieve excellent gating functions for target pulse signals. The photoelectron transmittances for different mesh electrode sizes and voltages were studied via numerical simulations. To increase the effective detection area of the photocathode, an electrostatic-focusing electrode was designed in the G-MCP-PMT. By optimizing the structure of the focusing electrode, an effective photocathode detection surface diameter of 80 mm was achieved based on commercially available MCPs with a diameter of 56 mm. By adjusting the channel diameter configurations of the dual MCPs, the output pulse peak and time response of the large-area G-MCP-PMT can be flexibly adjusted. The experimental results indicate that when the large-area G-MCP-PMT is operated at −2700 V, the gate establishment time is approximately 50 ns. The extinction ratio of the large-area G-MCP-PMT is higher than 3000:1, and the maximum linear output current is greater than 300 mA at 250 ns FWHM, meeting application needs in various fields such as white neutron detection and laser radar.},

abstract = {We report on performance results achieved for recently produced LAPPDs - largest commercially available planar geometry photodetectors based on microchannel plates. These results include electron gains of up to 107, low dark noise rates (∼100 Hz/cm2 at a gain of 6⋅106), single photoelectron (PE) timing resolution of ∼50 picoseconds RMS (electronics limited), and single photoelectron spatial resolution along and across strips of 3.2mm (electronics limited) and 0.8 mm RMS respectively and high (about 25% or higher in some units) QE uniform bi-alkali photocathodes. LAPPDs is a good candidate to be employed in neutrino experiments (e.g. ANNIE (Back et al., 2017) [1], WATCHMAN (Askins et al., 2015) [2], DUNE (Capozzi et al., 2018) [3]), particle collider experiments (e.g. EIC (Accardi et al., 2016) [4]), neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments (e.g. THEIA (Fischer et al., 2018) [5]), medical and nuclear non-proliferation applications.}

journal = {Machine Learning: Science and Technology},
abstract = {Imaging Cherenkov detectors are crucial for particle identification (PID) in nuclear and particle physics experiments. Fast reconstruction algorithms are essential for near real-time alignment, calibration, data quality control, and efficient analysis. At the future electron–ion collider (EIC), the ePIC detector will feature a dual Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector in the hadron direction, a Detector of Internally Reflected Cherenkov (DIRC) in the barrel, and a proximity focus RICH in the electron direction. This paper focuses on the DIRC detector, which presents complex hit patterns and is also used for PID of pions and kaons in the experiment at JLab. We present Deep(er)RICH, an extension of the seminal DeepRICH work, offering improved and faster PID compared to traditional methods and, for the first time, fast and accurate simulation. This advancement addresses a major bottleneck in Cherenkov detector simulations involving photon tracking through complex optical elements. Our results leverage advancements in Vision Transformers, specifically hierarchical Swin Transformer and normalizing flows. These methods enable direct learning from real data and the reconstruction of complex topologies. We conclude by discussing the implications and future extensions of this work, which can offer capabilities for PID for multiple cutting-edge experiments like the future EIC.}

abstract = {A proximity focusing ring imaging Cherenkov detector, with the radiator consisting of two or more aerogel layers of different refractive indices, has been tested in 1–4GeV/c pion beams at KEK. Essentially, a multiple refractive index aerogel radiator allows for an increase in Cherenkov photon yield on account of the increase in overall radiator thickness, while avoiding the simultaneous degradation in single photon angular resolution associated with the increased uncertainty of the emission point. With the refractive index of consecutive layers suitably increasing in the downstream direction, one may achieve overlapping of the Cherenkov rings from a single charged particle. In the opposite case of decreasing refractive index, one may obtain well separated rings. In the former combination an approximately 40% increase in photon yield is accompanied with just a minor degradation in single photon angular resolution. The impact of this improvement on the π/K separation at the upgraded Belle detector is discussed.}
