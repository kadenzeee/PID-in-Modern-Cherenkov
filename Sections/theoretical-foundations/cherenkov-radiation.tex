\label{sec:cherenkov-radiation}

Cherenkov radiation is a phenomenon that occurs when a charged particle travels through a dielectric medium 
with refractive index \(n(\lambda)\) at a speed greater than the phase velocity in that medium. This effect 
was first observed by Pavel Čherenkov in 1934 \cite{Cherenkov_1937} and later explained theoretically by Ilya 
Frank and Igor Tamm \cite{Frank_1937}.

From Maxwell's equations arises that electromagnetic propagation with wavelength \(\lambda\) will have its phase 
velocity modified by the medium it is travelling through. This leads to the idea of refractive index \(n(\lambda) = c/v\), 
defined as the ratio between the speed of light in vacuum \(c\) and the phase velocity \(v\) in the medium. The condition
for Cherenkov radiation to occur is then given by \(v > c/n\).

The Cherenkov radiation itself propagates at the phase velocity of the medium. As such, the radiation forms a 
conical wavefront with characteristic angle \(\theta\), similar to how shock cones are formed by supersonic 
aircraft. The angle \(\theta\) can be derived from simple geometric considerations shown in Fig \ref{fig:cherenkov-diagram}, yielding the following:

\begin{equation}
\cos{\theta} = \frac{v_p}{v} = \frac{c}{nv}
\label{equ:cherenkov-critical-angle}
\end{equation}

Photons are emitted at the phase velocity \(v_{p}\) and angle \(\theta\) to the path of travel of the particle, 
giving the characteristic blue shock cone.}\label{fig:cherenkov-diagram}
\end{figure}

The main principle behind a Cherenkov detector is to measure the angle \(\theta\) of the emitted photons,
which can then be used to determine the velocity \(v\) of the charged particle. With an associated momentum
measurement from a forward tracking detector, the mass of the particle can be inferred, allowing for spectroscopy.
This velocity spectroscopy for various particle species is shown in Fig \ref{fig:cherenkov-angle-COMPASS}.
It can be seen that pions, for example, will produce a larger Cherenkov angle than kaons or pions at the same momentum,
due to them being less massive.

The energy \(dE\) emitted per unit length is given by the Frank-Tamm formula, which can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\frac{dE}{dx} = \frac{q^2}{4\pi}\int_{v>\frac{c}{n(\omega)}}\mu(\omega)\omega\left( 1 - \frac{c^2}{v^2n^2(\omega)}\right) d\omega
\end{equation}

for a particle with charge \(q\) and frequency \(\omega\), moving through a medium with permeability \(\mu\) and 
refractive index \(n(\omega)\). The integral is taken over all frequencies where the Cherenkov condition \(v = c/n(\omega)\)
is met. By changing variables to wavelength \(\lambda\) and using that \(E = Nh\omega\), one can show that the 
number of photons \(N\) emitted per unit length is inversely proportional to the square of the wavelength. This
explains the characteristic blue of Cherenkov radiation, as shorter wavelength (blue light) photons are emitted more.
