Large Area Picosecond Photodetectors (LAPPDs) are modern MCP-PMTs that harness many 
advances in machining and materials technology. Advances in glass manufacturing allow 
for borosilicate glass tiles to form large area vacuum housings for sensitive layers.
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) allows for extremely precise tailoring of MCPs compared
to traditional methods of manufacturing \cite{ald-mcps-Popecki_2016}. They feature 
good dark count rates (100 \(\text{Hz/cm}^2\)), an impressive timing resolution 
(50 \(\text{ps}\)), an improved spatial resolution, and a great QE \cite{LYASHENKO2020162834}.
